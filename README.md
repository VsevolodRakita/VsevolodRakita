## About Me
I am a PhD holder in Mathematics from the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, specializing in Combinatorics and Graph Theory. My academic journey has been fueled by a passion for exploring complex mathematical structures and theories. 

Although I am new to the industry, my research has involved:

Theoretical Contributions: My thesis explored the extremal, logical, and probabilistic properties of two large classes of graph polynomials: generating polynomials and Harary polynomials.
Teaching: I've honed my communication skills by teaching undergraduate courses in Calculus, Abstract Algebra, and Combinatorial Algorithms.
Academic Publications: Authored 5 papers on graph polynomials, which can be found <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=QkWGw3IAAAAJ"> here</a>.

## Skills
Programming Languages: Python, C, C++, Rust, LaTeX.
Data Analysis: Proficiency in Python data analysis packages, including numpy, pandas, polars, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and pytorch.

## Projects
### Jane Street Real Time Market Data Forecasting: 
Notebooks for the Jane Street Real-Time Market Data Forecasting Kaggle competition.
### C Compiler:
A C to x86 assembly compiler, implemented in rust.
### Derivative Pricer
A Black-Scholes derivative pricer for vanilla and exotic options, implemented in rust.

##Goals
I'm eager to apply my theoretical knowledge in practical settings, contribute to open-source projects, and collaborate on innovative mathematical applications. 

##Interests
Beyond academia, I am interested in machine learning, quantetative finance, and data science.
